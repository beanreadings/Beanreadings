# Beanreadings
Beanreadings is a library for simulating the future. We make many predictions, model and plot to show how the future might look like based on many different configurable options, and what we can do to ensure human longevity on Earth.
## Installation
You don't have to install beanreadings, it's at [beanreadings](https://beanreadings.github.io). Please try it out today!
## Building from source
If you want to build beanreadings from source, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Beanreadings/beanreadings.git
cd beanreadings
sh build.sh
```
This builds the rust code into WebAssembly and then builds the website using the WebAssembly.
## Forecasts
Beanreadings has predicted the following:

As we believe the National Institute of Health is a reliable source, we have used their information to make our predictions. We have also used the USDA's data tables, and CDC's statistics. Every site on this list should be from a reliable source, preferably from a government page. As the government of the United States is a large government, with much data and abundant research papers, much of our research and simulations are based on data from their sources.

## Notes (we will delete this later)
The death rate is increasing around 1.5% per year.
